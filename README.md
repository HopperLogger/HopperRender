# HopperRender
An optical flow frame interpolator with DirectShow integration that allows you to watch any local media file in 60 fps.
This is my first DirectShow and CUDA project. The goal is to achieve pretty decent frame interpolation with a variety of user customizable settings.
The filter can be added to a DirectShow media player like MPC-HC or MPC-BE in combination with madVR as the renderer.
Please keep in mind that this project is still in ongoing development and there are very likely some bugs depending on the environment you're running and the setting you use.
